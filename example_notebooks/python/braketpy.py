# ## AWS via pytket

# This notebook describes how to how to run a simple circuit using the `pytket-braket` backend from scratch.

# ### Prerequisites

# #### Python packages:

# - `pytket`'s extension for Amazon Braket devices [pytket-braket](https://pypi.org/project/pytket-braket/)
#     - `pip install pytket-braket`
# - Amazon's braket package [amazon-braket-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/amazon-braket-sdk/)
#     - `pip install amazon-braket-sdk`
# - `boto3`, which is Amazon's package for accessing AWS (so called because Boto dolphins live in the Amazon ðŸ™„) [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/)
#     - `pip install boto3`


# ### What are we doing?

# There is a hierarchy of things we need to access here, as illustrated below. Amazon Web Services (AWS) contains many things, one of which is Amazon Braket. That in turn contains many quantum devices we can run things on.

# Essentially we nest interfaces from the three packages above to access each layer of services:
# $$
# \textrm{amazon web services} \rightarrow \textrm{amazon braket} \rightarrow \textrm{quantum device}
# $$

# ### Credentials

# You need the following credentials to access devices with AWS:
# - AWS account ID (12 digits) or account alias
# - User name
# - Password

# And for accessing services in python, a public and private key:
# - AWS access key ID
# - AWS secret access key


# ### What is S3?

# Amazon has a Dropbox-like service called Amazon S3 -- Simple Storage Service. This is a service under the AWS umbrella where results from experiments can be saved. These are saved in top-level folders called 'S3 buckets'.


# ### Setting up AWS

# #### Checking the region for the device you want
# - Find Amazon Braket and go to 'Devices'
# - Check the `region` for the device you want to access (e.g. for OQC's Lucy device, this is `eu-west-2`)

# #### Create an S3 bucket
# - Under AWS, go to Amazon S3 and create a new bucket and choose a `name` and the `region` from above. __NOTE:__ the `name` __must__ start with the prefix `amazon-braket`, e.g. `amazon-braket-my-test-experiment`!
# - Once you've created the bucket, select it and create a folder inside. In python, the name of this folder becomes known as the `bucket_key`.

# #### Create a credentials file
# - Finally, in the directory you're working in, create a file with the following format, and name it somethign sensible like `aws_creds.txt`:

#     aws_access_key_id
#     aws_secret_access_key
#     s3_name [i.e. the name of your bucket]
#     bucket_key [i.e. the name of the folder you created in the bucket]
    

# ### Running a circuit

# For the purposes of this example, we'll assume that you've created the files above, and that we want to access OQC's Lucy quantum device.
